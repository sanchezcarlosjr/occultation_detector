======================
Occulatations detector
======================


    Detect Serendipitous Stellar Occultations with Deep Learning

The Ocultation Detector extracts properties of Trans-Neptunian Objects using high-cadence light curves, such as diffraction patterns. It can determine the shape, distance to the occulting body, radius of the occulting body, and the impact parameter. The detector has been trained on a dataset of light curves simulated using an event simulator for TAOS II.


Installation
===============
.. code-block:: bash

   pip install occulations_detector
